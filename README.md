About this Project 

In this project, I am trying to create a Facebook clone named "ChatNook" and get some of its functions to work. As a starter, I plan to have login and signup forms that connect to the database to add and retrieve data from it. In addition, when the user logs in, they can see, edit, and delete information, also with the ability to delete the whole profile.

Logged-in users also can access a "feed page" where they can write posts and see other users' posts.

Also, the platform will have a function for administrators to log in and administrate profiles and posts, meaning that they can edit, add, and delete profiles, but are only able to delete posts when necessary.

This project is being built using JAVA RESTful Web Services. some of the HTML forms will send data in JSON format by AJAX to a RESTful web service, in addition, I will use post-type requests to send data in other forms. To receive data I will also use AJAX and GET type requests
