About this Project

In this project, I am trying to create a dynamic webiste (ChatNook) that is highly inspired by Facebook interface. As a starter, I plan to have login and signup forms that connect to a database to add and retrieve data from it. In addition, when a user logs in they can retrieve, edit their information, and delete their account. Account deletion requires further authentication.

In the future Logged-in users will have a possibility to access a "feed page" where they can write posts and see other users' posts. In addition, the platform will have a function for administrators to log in and administrate profiles and posts, meaning that they can edit, add, and delete profiles, but are only able to delete posts when necessary.

This project is being built with java using RESTful Web Services and servlets. Most of the forms will use post-type requests to send data.

The interface is built using HTML, CSS, JS and JSP.
