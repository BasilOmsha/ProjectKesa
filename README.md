About this Project 

In this project I am trying to create a facebook clone and get some of its functions working. As a starter, my plan is to have a login and a signup forms that connect to the database to add and retrive data from it. In addition, when the user logs in, they are able to see, edit, and delete information, also with the ability to delete the whole profile. 

Logged in users also can access a "feed page" where they can write postes and see other users posts. 

Also the platform will have a fucntion for administrators ot login and administrate profiles and posts, meaning that they can edit, add, and delete profiles, but only able to delete posts when necessary. 

This project is being built using JAVA RESTful Web Services. some of the HTML forms will send data in JSON format by AJAX to a RESTful web service, in addtion, I will use post type request to send data in other forms. To receive data I will also use AJAX and GET type request.
